##Alex's Journey

I'm a student, first and foremost, and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. 
It's been a wild ride to where I am now and there's a long ways to go. Along the way, I've met many
individuals who've pointed me in this way and that. Each of these people&mdash;friends, friends of 
friends, family, co-workers, strangers and all&mdash;have left some mark on me, imparted some 
wisdom that got me here and now I want to take a minute (or many) to reflect on those moments, no
 matter how impactful or inconsequential, because I value each and every one of these connections.


This is a work in progress that I plan to continue working on and adding to as I add people to my 
journey through some exciting new work.
